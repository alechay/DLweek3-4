# Week 6 Assignment

## Objective

The goal for this assignment was to tinker with the Neural Network Playground and see how different manipulations affect the output of the model. There were 3 main objectives:

1. Play with the regularization types, adjust the learning rate, activation functions etc and see how it affects the model.
2. Try to understand the different feature types, and how the noise and batch size impact the model as well.
3. Adjust the number of layers / neurons. Did that improve the output or make it worse? Why?

## Base output

## Learning Rate

## Activation functions

## Feature types
